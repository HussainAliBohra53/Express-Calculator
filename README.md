# Express-Calculator
Express Calculator is an online mathematical utility tool that features a scientific calculator, tools to save your calculated results in variables that can be used in later calculations and you can create your own equations or say expressions using these variables. An expression can be used with another expression and also could be nested into another expression.

### Features :
***1) Expression Builder:***  
Express calculator helps you to construct your expression by inserting variables, numbers, and mathematical operators.
You can also nest an expression inside another. Nesting of expression helps you to make big and complex expressions from small and simple expressions. 

***2) Declare Variables :***  
Variables are alphabets that represent a value. In the express calculator, you can easily create a variable and use it wherever you want to use it's value. Change the value of a variable and it will change the value wherever it's being used immediately. 

***3) Calculates on change***  
No need to hit enter or to press '=' after every change. Whether you are changing the value of variables or expressions or just numbers on the calculator pad, Express calculator recalculates, and update everything after every change.

***4) Easy to use UI***  
UI is divided into three sections: calculator, variable bar and expression bar make things very clear, simple, and easy to use. Expression bar shows expressions in collapse mode and you can expand or collapse every layer at your convenience. Also, UI is responsive and works awesome on mobile devices too. 

***5) Storing Locally***  
Express calculator uses HTML storage API to store the data in the browser's memory. It store the data after every change automatically so no need to worry on tab closed accidentally.

# Start with repository 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
